// A photo of a small, fluffy, white kitten sitting with a slight lean to the left, its legs together. Its head is turned approximately 20 degrees to the right, and its gaze is directed towards the upper right, giving it a pensive expression. Its fur is long and soft, with a naturally messy look, appearing slightly damp. Some strands fall over its forehead, partially obscuring its left eye, while the rest cascades over its shoulders and chest. It has soft facial features and fair skin, with thin, naturally shaped eyebrows. Its almond-shaped eyes have narrow eyelids and black pupils. Its nose is small and straight, and its lips are slightly thin with a light coral pink lipstick. Small, almost unnoticeable earrings adorn its ears. It wears a white, shirt-style dress with a relatively low V-neck that reveals its collarbone. The dress material is thin and breathable, slightly sheer, with natural folds and a subtle sheen. The sleeves are loose and lantern-styled, reaching its wrists with slightly tightened cuffs. The skirt falls to the floor, covering its legs. Its hands are clasped together and rest on its left knee. The lighting comes from the upper left and is soft, casting gentle highlights on the left side of its face, shoulder, arm, and skirt, while the right side is subtly shadowed. The moderate contrast in lighting creates a hazy atmosphere. The background is a solid, dark bluish-gray color with a smooth, soft texture.`;
